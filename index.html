<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p id="1" class="o">1: Lasts for 4 hours at a time.  See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditDads/comments/52bt6t/vip_work_the_wave_method/" target="_blank">this post</a> for best technique.</p>
<p id="2" class="e">2: Become a CEO instead of VIP from this point on.</p>
<p id="3" class="o">3: Unlocks Import/Export missions(I/E).  There are 32 base types of cars that you can source for your warehouse.  As long as your Warehouse has 31, or fewer, cars in it and no duplicates you will always source one of the missing base types.  License plates don't matter.  Basically <strong>never</strong> have more than 32 cars in your warehouse and immediately get rid of any accidental duplicates.  Always do the $100,000 special delivery option with a Top Range vehicle on cooldown.</p>
<p id="4" class="e">4: In a solo lobby you will always be attacked by AI.  They will have 4 waves if you want to stop your vehicle and get out to kill them in order to avoid damage(lost profit).  When delivering a vehicle you can outrun them, but they will keep up with you when sourcing a vehicle.  I think they also don't spawn if at least 1 person is in lobby that is not in your organization.</p>
<p id="5" class="o">5: Gameplay loop becomes: Deliver favorite top end vehicle for 100k(80k profit).  Immediately source a vehicle of the type you just delivered to get back to 32 vehicles in warehouse.  Do other things until the 20 minute delivery timer expires(20 minutes from when you start the delivery).</p>
<p id="6" class="e">6: For VIP work mostly.  Not strictly necessary, but speeds up missions.</p>
<p id="7" class="o">7: Eventually you will want to do research as there are some nice things to unlock.  51 total unlocks.</p>
<p id="8" class="e">8: Bunker takes ~2 hours 20 minutes to use 1 full bar of supply.  Sell every time you resupply to only deal with 1 delivery vehicle.  Buy your supplies instead of stealing.</p>
<p id="9" class="o">9: Leave the businesses inactive.  We only want them for the nightclub passive gain.</p>
<p id="10" class="e">10: Sell nightclub stock after 20 hours.  When Coke and Meth cap.</p>
<p id="11" class="o">11: Unlocks Client Jobs mission types.  Can also start vehicle source missions.</p>

<h2>AFK tips:</h2>
<p class="e">Your businesses cannot be raided unless you are in free roam.</p>
<p class="o">Start a mission that doesn't have a timer(EG Pier Pressure or Cleaning the Cathouse).  Go to your apartment and watch tv (sit -&gt; watch).  You will no longer get disconnected for idle.</p>
<p class="e">Buy Bunker supplies(75k) and wait 15 minutes for them to be delivered then wait for 1 tick to disappear.  Buy supplies again(15k) and then go to missions/heists/etc.  The second delivery timer won't tick down until you are back in free roam.  However your bunker will use all the supplies.  The resupply will completely fill the bunker after you spend 15 minutes in free roam again.</p>

<h2>General Tips:</h2>
<p class="o">Try to buy an office, Vehicle Warehouse, Bunker, and Nightclub near the center of the map.  Not the cheapest options.</p>
<p class="e">GTA5 has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/search?q=flair%3Apsa+discount&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=month" target="_blank">weekly double $/rp events and sales</a> on various items, including businesses and upgrades.  Some double $/rp events may be better to grind while they are active.</p>
<p class="o">Nightclub, Bunker, and similar will only generate output while your account is in game.</p>
<p class="e">Opressor MkII is great for when you can afford it.  Helpful on several VIP/Client jobs and can participate in the "race me for my pink slip" vehicle sourcing missions.</p>
<p class="o">Cargobob is excellent for I/E.  If you fly high enough AI enemies will not spawn and your vehicle won't be damaged.</p>
<p class="e">Crates can be substituted for I/E.  But take longer to set up before a payout and you risk getting $0 for hours of work. I/E is more consistent.</p>
<p class="o">Dailies: $25,000/day, $100,000 every 7 days in a row, $500,000 every 28 days in a row.</p>

<h2>Tips when playing with friends</h2>
<p class="e">Only VIP work and Client Jobs pay associates fairly.</p>
<p class="o">Can Rotate VIP work + Client Jobs cooldowns between up to 4 people.  Disbanding and joining the next CEO as missions are on cooldown.</p>
<p class="e">Do the Heists.  They can provide significant payouts and have several 1 time bonuses.</p>
<ul>
    <li class="o">All in order: $1,000,000 Complete every heist, including setup missions, in order.</li>
    <li class="e">Loyalty: $1,000,000 Complete all heists on any difficulty with the same team of players.</li>
    <li class="o">Criminal Mastermind: $10,000,000 Complete every heist (including setup missions) in order, with the same team members on hard difficulty with no deaths.  Any failure resets the challenge.</li>
</ul>
