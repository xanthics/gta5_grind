    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p id="1" class="o">1: Lasts for 4 hours at a time.  See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditDads/comments/52bt6t/vip_work_the_wave_method/" target="_blank">this post</a> for best technique.</p>
    <p id="2" class="e">2: Become a CEO instead of VIP from this point on.</p>
    <p id="3" class="o">3: Unlocks Import/Export missions(I/E).  You can only change warehouse if it's empty.  There are 32 base types of cars that you can source for your warehouse.  As long as your Warehouse has 31, or fewer, cars in it and no duplicates you will always source one of the missing base types.  License plates don't matter.  Basically <strong>never</strong> have more than 32 cars in your warehouse and immediately get rid of any accidental duplicates.  Always do the $100,000 special delivery option with a Top Range vehicle on cooldown.</p>
    <p id="4" class="e">4: In a solo lobby you will always be attacked by AI.  They will have 4 waves if you want to stop your vehicle and get out to kill them in order to avoid damage(lost profit).  When delivering a vehicle you can outrun them, but they will keep up with you when sourcing a vehicle.  AI doesn't spawn on deliveries if at least 1 person is in lobby that is not in your organization.</p>
    <p id="5" class="o">5: Gameplay loop becomes: Deliver favorite top end vehicle for 100k(80k profit).  Immediately source a vehicle of the type you just delivered to get back to 32 vehicles in warehouse.  Do other things until the 20 minute delivery timer expires(20 minutes from when you start the delivery).</p>
    <p id="6" class="e">6: For VIP work mostly.  Not strictly necessary, but speeds up missions.</p>
    <p id="7" class="o">7: Eventually you will want to do research as there are some nice things to unlock.</p>
    <p id="8" class="e">8: Bunker takes ~2 hours 20 minutes to use 1 full bar of supply.  Sell every time you resupply to only deal with 1 delivery vehicle.  Buy your supplies instead of stealing.</p>
    <p id="9" class="o">9: Businesses need to be in "production" mode for the nightclub, but you don't need any upgrades as we won't actually be keeping them stocked.  We only want them for the nightclub passive gain.</p>
    <p id="10" class="e">10: Sell nightclub stock after 20 hours, when Coke and Meth cap.  Can sell earlier but later is a loss.</p>
    <p id="11" class="o">11: Unlocks Client Jobs mission types.  After finishing an I/E delivery, request your Terrorbyte(Interaction menu), then start a vehicle source mission and put the Terrorbyte back in storage.</p>
    <p id="12" class="e">12: You should get the security upgrades for Bunker and Nightclub at this point.  You should also buy and upgrade the small(Speedo Custom) and mid(Mule Custom) size Nightclub delivery vehicle so those are easier.</p>
    <p id="13" class="o">13: Grind Priority is I/E deliver > I/E source > Nightclub delivery if full > Bunker Delivery if finished > Favorite VIP and Client jobs to fill the gaps.  Make sure you take breaks and enjoy other aspects of the game as well.  It's no fun if it feels like a job/chore.  Also take time to do unlocks for vehicles that you like, such as Arena Wars Motorcycles.</p>

    <h2>Recommended Business Locations:</h2>
    <p class="e">Vehicle Warehouse: Personal preference.  I'd recommend watching a "where they are" video before buying.  I chose La Puerta ($2,735,000) as I find it has the best routes to and from.</p>
    <p class="o">Bunker: Farmhouse ($2,375,000) or Chumash ($1,650,000)</p>
    <p class="e">Nightclub: West Vinewood ($1,700,000), Downtown Vinewood ($1,670,000), Mission Row ($1,440,000) or Strawberry ($1,525,000)</p>
    <p class="o">Yacht: None.  Adds a daily cost with no benefit beyond aesthetics.</p>
    <p class="e">Hanger: Fort Zancudo ($2,085,000 - $3,250,000) gives "low level" access to the base which lets you enter without getting a wanted level.</p>
    <p class="o">Facilities:  Whereever you prefer.  Used for Doomsday Heists, so skip if you aren't hosting those.</p>

    <h2>AFK tips:</h2>
    <p class="e">Your businesses cannot be raided unless you are in free roam.</p>
    <p class="o">Go to your apartment and watch tv (sit -&gt; watch).  You will no longer get disconnected for idle.  Do this in a mission that doesn't have a timer(EG Pier Pressure or Cleaning the Cathouse) to avoid daily fees.</p>
    <p class="e">Buy Bunker supplies(75k) and wait 15 minutes for them to be delivered then wait for 1 tick to disappear.  Buy supplies again(15k) and then go to missions/heists/etc.  The second delivery timer won't tick down until you are back in free roam.  However your bunker will use all the supplies.  The resupply will completely fill the bunker after you spend 15 minutes in free roam again.</p>

    <h2>General Tips:</h2>
    <p class="o">Try to buy an office, Vehicle Warehouse, Bunker, and Nightclub near the center of the map.  Not the cheapest options.</p>
    <p class="e">GTA5 has <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/events" target="_blank">weekly double $/rp events and sales</a> on various items, including businesses and upgrades.  Some double $/rp events may be better to grind while they are active.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/search?q=flair%3Apsa+discount&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=month" target="_blank">Reddit posts with better formatting but slower updates</a></p>
    <p class="o">Nightclub, Bunker, and similar will only generate output while your account is in game.</p>
    <p class="e">Opressor MkII is great for when you can afford it.  Helpful on several VIP/Client jobs and can participate in the "race me for my pink slip" vehicle sourcing missions.</p>
    <p class="o">Cargobob can be helpful for solo I/E.  If you fly high enough AI enemies will not spawn.</p>
    <p class="e">Crates can be substituted for VIP and Client Jobs.  But take longer to set up before a payout and you risk getting $0 for hours of work. VIP and Client Jobs are more consistent.</p>
    <p class="o">Dailies: $25,000/day, $100,000 every 7 days in a row, $500,000 every 28 days in a row.</p>
    <p class="e">Businesses create output at the end of every tick, all production timers are reset when you "zone/load".  If you are grinding contact missions(or any other activity with a lot of zoning) faster than the tick interval, the business will fail to create output.  Common tick intervals(with all upgrades):</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="o">Bunker: 7 minutes.</li>
        <li class="e">Nightclub Cash Creation: 30 minutes.</li>
        <li class="o">Nightclub Sporting Good: 40 minutes.</li>
        <li class="e">Nightclub Pharmaceutical Research: 60 minutes.</li>
        <li class="o">Nightclub Cargo and Shipments: 70 minutes.</li>
        <li class="e">Nightclub South American Imports: 120 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips when playing with friends:</h2>
    <p class="o">Only VIP work and Client Jobs pay associates fairly.  The CEO can change the cut so a specific Associate gets more.</p>
    <p class="e">Can Rotate VIP work + Client Jobs cooldowns between people.  Disbanding and joining the next CEO as missions are on cooldown.</p>
    <p class="o">Do the Heists.  They can provide significant payouts and have several 1 time bonuses.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="e">All in order: $1,000,000 Complete every heist, including setup missions, in order.</li>
        <li class="o">Loyalty: $1,000,000 Complete all heists on any difficulty with the same team of players.</li>
        <li class="e">Criminal Mastermind: $10,000,000 Complete every heist (including setup missions) in order, with the same team members on hard difficulty with no deaths.  Any failure resets the challenge.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="o">Being near a CEO that you are an associate of gives you passive income.  Starts at $5k per 15 minutes, raising by 10% every time the CEO completes VIP Work, I/E, or similar and drops 10% every time they die. Caps at $10k per 15 minutes.  You also get about $1,250 per hour for good behaviour.  <strike>If the CEO is willing to afk at a loss and you do not have too many expenses yet, EG no Bunker or later, you could afk watching the same tv and recieve about 41k/hour which is a similar pay rate to a fully upgraded Nightclub.</strike> (I cannot get afk $ to work, even though you still get 200rp/minute)</p>

    <h2>Recommended Weapon Loadout:</h2>
    <p class="e">With a weapon locker you can define a custom loadout for free roam.  There is room for customization here, this is merely a suggested loadout for PvE.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="o"><b>Pistol:</b> AP Pistol or MKII Heavy Revolver w/ Hollow Point rounds</li>
        <li class="e"><b>Machine Guns:</b> Combat MG MKII</li>
        <li class="o"><b>Assault Rifle:</b> Special Carbine (Drum Magazine)</li>
        <li class="e"><b>Sniper:</b> Heavy Sniper MKII (Explosive Rounds if you want to blow up vehicles)</li>
        <li class="o"><b>Shotgun:</b> Pump Shotgun MKII w/ Explosive Rounds, or Assault Shotgun</li>
        <li class="e"><b>Throwables:</b> Sticky Bomb</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommended Vehicles:</h2>
    <p class="o"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nQND3ikiLzS3Ij9kuV-rVkRtoYetb79c52JWyafb4m4/edit#gid=999161401" target="_blank">Broughy Spreadsheet</a> for comparing vehicle top speeds and lap times.</p>

    <h2>Helpful AHK Scripts:</h2>
    <p class="e"><b>These timer scripts are built with AHK 1.1.x</b></p>
    <p class="o"><a href="business timer.ahk">Business Timers</a> A multitimer script for tracking business output during gameplay.<br />
    Ctrl + Numpad Divide to reset Bunker Timer and Supply<br />
    Ctrl + Numpad Minus to reset Nightclub Supply<br />
    Ctrl + Numpad Plus to freeze all timers when you start zoning.  EG joining contact mission.<br />
    Ctrl + Numpad Enter to reset all timers and re-enable them when you have finished zoning.<br />
    Current timer setup assumes you have all upgrades.</p>
    <p class="e"><a href="mission timer.ahk">Mission Timer</a> for more efficient contact grinding.  Will tell you to turn in a mission or wait.  Reset with numpad divide.</p>
